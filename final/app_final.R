# 1. Shiny Apps have two basic parts to them
#
#   - The user interface (UI) defines how the app should look.
#
#     -- For example, the text on the page, the placement of the elements, etc.
#
#   - The server defines how the app should behave.
#
#     -- This is how live elements are updated - like selecting a state from a list.
#
#   - Those two pieces are combined by running shinyApp(ui, server) to create the app.
#
#      -- You can also click the green "Run App" button on the top right or
#         run runApp() in the console

ui <- fluidPage(

  # - UIs are built from "panel" functions, which specify areas of your page.
  #
  #   -- There is a "main panel," a "sidebar," a "title," etc.

  # Here is a sidebar!

  sidebarPanel(

    selectInput(inputId = "selected_state",                  # a name for the value you choose here
                label = "Choose a state from this list!",    # the name to display on the slider
                choices = state.names),                      # your list of choices to choose from

    sliderInput(inputId = "selected_size",                   # a name for the value you choose here
                label = "Choose a number as a point size:",  # the label to display above the slider
                min = 0, max = 5, value = 2)                 # the min, max, and initial values

  ),


  # And here is your "main panel" for the page.

  mainPanel(

    # - You can also make your UI more complicated with UI elements.
    #
    #   -- In general, these are defined by functions that you give arguments to (e.g. min and max values).
    #
    # - These include:
    #
    #   -- selectInput() to choose from multiple options.
    #
    #   -- sliderInput() lets you choose a value from a slider of values you define.
    #
    #   -- radioButtons() let you choose a button from a number of options
    #
    #   -- textInput() lets you enter whatever text you want.
    #
    #   -- Lots of other options, like entering a date. Look at the resources for other choices!
    #
    # - You then assign these inputs to a value and use those values in other places, like in plots!
    #
    # - All of these functions have their own arguments. For example:

    radioButtons(inputId = "selected_color",                 # a name for the value you choose here
                 label = "Choose a color!",                  # the label to display above the buttons
                 choices = c("red", "blue", "green")),       # the button values to choose from

    textInput(inputId = "entered_text",                      # a name for the value you choose here
              label = "Place your title text here:",         # a label above the text box
              value = "Example Title"),                      # an initial value for the box

    textOutput("state_message"), # here, we load a text object called "state_message"
    textOutput("size_message"),
    textOutput("color_message"),
    textOutput("text_message"),
    plotOutput("state_plot")
  )

  # - Then, you use these named objects to update the data on your site via the input object.
